- Fetches 50 Hard problems
- Total: 500 real LeetCode problems
- Takes 10-15 minutes

### **Option 2: Quick Test (10 Sample Problems)**
```bash
cd backend
npm run seed
```
- Instant seeding
- 10 sample problems
- Good for testing

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **How Filtering Works:**

When you click a topic on Roadmap:
1. `handleTopicClick()` is called with category and difficulty
2. URL parameters are created: `?category=Array&difficulty=Easy`
3. User is navigated to `/problems` with parameters
4. Problems page reads URL parameters
5. Filters are auto-applied
6. API is called with filters
7. Results are displayed

### **Categories Available:**
- Array
- String
- Linked List
- Tree
- Graph
- Dynamic Programming
- Stack
- Hash Table
- Math
- Sorting
- Heap
- Trie
- Greedy
- Backtracking
